    <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
    <h3>Act 2, Scene 2</h3>
    <h4>The Famous Balcony Scene</h4>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?  
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?  
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name.</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;  
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;  
    For stony limits cannot hold love out.</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;  
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay",  
    And I will take thy word.</p>

    <p><strong>Romeo:</strong> Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear  
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree topsâ€”</p>

    <p><strong>Juliet:</strong> O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,  
    That monthly changes in her circled orb.</p>
